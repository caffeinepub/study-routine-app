  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for both REQ-1 and REQ-2. The global CSS (index.css) is updated to store raw OKLCH channel values without the oklch() wrapper so Tailwind's oklch(var(--token)) pattern resolves correctly. Dashboard.tsx is updated with explicit text color classes for hero overlay text and corrected chapter completion logic. The tailwind.config.js is described as using oklch(var(--token)) pattern. Both requirements appear substantially addressed.",
